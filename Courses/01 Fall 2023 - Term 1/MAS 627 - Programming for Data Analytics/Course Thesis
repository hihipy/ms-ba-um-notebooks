From Syllabus:

"This course will do a deep dive into R programming for working with data. We will cover a wide range of topics likely to be encountered when working with real data sets, including techniques for collecting, cleaning, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data, and will dabble with interactive web applications. I hope to teach you how to do all of this in a clean and reproducible manner. While we are using R here, I will emphasize transferable skills for solving common problem that you will encounter regardless of language or tool."

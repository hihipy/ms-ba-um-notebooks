# Handout on Simple Linear Regression 2

## 1. A sample of 10 billionaires is selected, and the personâ€™s age and net worth (in billions) are compared. The data are given here: X (age): 56, 39, 42, 60, 84, 37, 68, 66, 73, 55 & Y (net worth in Billions USD): 18, 14, 12, 14, 11, 10, 10, 7, 7, 5

### 1. (a & b) Find $\widehat{y}$ for each x & find a residual for each x.

```{r}
x = c(56, 39, 42, 60, 84, 37, 68, 66, 73, 55)
y = c(18, 14, 12, 14, 11, 10, 10, 7, 7, 5)

df = data.frame(x , y)

model = lm(y~x, data = df)

data.frame(df, y_hat = fitted(model), e = residuals(model))

```

### 1. (c) Calculate the sum of squares total (SST).

```{r}

SST = sum()

```

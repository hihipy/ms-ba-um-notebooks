From Course Syllabus:
"Applied Regression Analysis and Forecasting. This course covers applied regression. Topics include simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and if time permits, other types of regression models. I will also be discussing prediction, inference, stepwise variable selection, and model selection. In summation, I will try to touch on anything and everything that has to do with regression in an applied manner."

The pair demonstrated that their efficient frontier figure had skewed data, resulting in a poor efficient frontier indication—not ideal for a profitable and diverse portfolio. Even the inclusion of a constraint for the upper bound on the 20 stocks’ Individual Weights did little to enhance the diversity and profitability of the portfolio. Only 5 of the airline stocks had a weight greater than zero, with a sixth having a negligible weight.\n","\n","\n","* [ATSG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ATSG) | Weight: 0.2000 | Initial Investment: \\$200,000\n","* [LUV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LUV) | Weight: 0.2000 | Initial Investment: \\$200,000\n","* [RYAAY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RYAAY) | Weight: 0.2000 | Initial Investment: \\$200,000\n","* [CPA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CPA) | Weight: 0.1986 | Initial Investment: \\$198,600\n","* [DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL) | Weight: 0.1882 | Initial Investment: \\$188,200\n","* [ULCC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ULCC) | Weight: 0.0132 | Initial Investment: \\$13,200\n","\n","Rodrigo and Philip confidently asserted to Tom Cruise that this was a pivotal lesson for Connor Antony: portfolios need to have diversification across multiple industries and company sizes.

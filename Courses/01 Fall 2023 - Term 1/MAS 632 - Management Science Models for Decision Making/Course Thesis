From Syllabus:

"Around 85% of Fortune 500 companies use mathematical optimization in their operations. The ability to translate practical problems into optimization models that are amenable to analysis requires critical thinking and imagination, and is an essential skill for business analytics professionals aiming to develop efficient solu- tions to practical problems. This course introduces the principles and techniques of applied mathematical programming, spreadsheet modeling, and computational methods for managerial decision-making. The students will develop their math- ematical modeling skills, learn standard optimization techniques, and enhance their decision-making capabilities. Computer software will be used extensively to solve efficiently both small-scale and large-scale optimization problems."

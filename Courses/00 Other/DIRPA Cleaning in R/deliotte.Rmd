# Checking the Overall Structure of the Data
glimpse(df)  
# The function glimpse() from the dplyr package is used to print a concise 
# summary of a dataframe (df), providing a quick look of the variable 
# names, their type, and a few of their values.

# Checking Unique Values
unique_overview(df)  
# Assuming unique_overview is a custom function or from a specific library, 
# it is likely utilized to return or print a summary about the unique 
# values in each column of the dataframe (df). This could help in identifying 
# categorical variables and understanding data diversity.

# Checking for Missing Values
df |> 
  summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.))))
# The above code is utilizing a combination of summarize(), across(), and 
# is.na() functions in order to determine the number of NA (missing) values 
# in each column of the dataframe (df). 
# - summarize() will create summary statistics of different variables. 
# - across(everything()) applies the summarization across all columns. 
# - ~sum(is.na(.)) calculates the sum of all NA values per column.

# Issues/Items to Clean:
# Here the programmer identified potential issues in the data that need cleaning 
# before further analysis or modelling is done. This is a vital step in data preprocessing.
# Each item specifies the column and a brief description of what needs to be adjusted:
# - 'Place' should be converted from character to integer.
# - 'Ag' should be changed from character to integer.
# - 'Gun Tim', 'Net Tim', and 'Pace' should be converted from character (in MM:SS format) 
#   to double by translating the time to total seconds.
# This documentation helps to guide the subsequent data cleaning and transformation processes.

# Note: The '#$' symbols are likely used for easy navigation between different cleaning 
# items, and the character descriptions and transformation objectives are clear for 
# future reference or for other developers.

#Question 1

What are the mean, median, mode, and range of the race results for all
racers by gender?

```{r Q1}
# Define a custom function to calculate mode.
# The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.
calculate_mode = function(x) {
  # 'table(x)' creates a table of the counts of each unique value in x.
  tbl = table(x)
  
  # Find the highest frequency (most occurrences) among the unique values.
  max_freq = max(tbl)
  
  # Find the value(s) that correspond to the maximum frequency.
  # 'names(tbl)' provides the unique values in x,
  # 'tbl == max_freq' identifies which of these have the maximum frequency,
  # and 'as.numeric()' converts these value(s) from character to numeric (if they aren't already).
  mode = as.numeric(names(tbl[tbl == max_freq]))
  
  # Return the mode value(s).
  return(mode)
}

# Use the pipe operator (%>%) to chain together a sequence of operations using 'cleaned_df'.
cleaned_df |> 
  # Group data by the 'Gender' variable. This means subsequent operations will be
  # performed separately on each subset of the data defined by unique gender values.

    # Calculate and display the mode of 'Net Tim (sec)' using the custom function.
    `Mode (sec)` = calculate_mode(`Net Tim (sec)`),

#Question 2

#Question 3

3.  How much time separates Chris Doe from the top 10 percentile of
    racers of the same division?

```{r Q3}
# 1. Identify Chris Doe's division and time
# Filter the dataframe to get the row with Chris Doe's details
chris_doe = cleaned_df|> 
  filter(Name == "Chris Doe")|>
  select(Name, Div, `Net Tim (sec)`)

# Print Chris's details for reference

# 2. Calculate the top 10 percentile time in Chris's division
# Get all racers in Chris's division and calculate the 90th percentile time
top_10_percentile_time_sec = cleaned_df|> 
  filter(Div == chris_doe$Div)|>  # Filter by Chris's division
  summarise(top_10_perc_time = quantile(`Net Tim (sec)`, 0.90))  # Calculate the 90th percentile time

# Print the top 10 percentile time for reference
print(top_10_percentile_time_sec)

# 3. Calculate the time difference
# Calculate how much time Chris needs to make up to reach the top 10 percentile in his division
time_difference = top_10_percentile_time_sec$top_10_perc_time - chris_doe$`Net Tim (sec)`

# Print the result
cat("Chris Doe needs to improve by", time_difference, 
            "seconds to reach the top 10 percentile in their division.")
```

#Question 4

Compare the race results of each division.

```{r Q4}
# STEP 1: ANALYZE THE DATA
# Compute summary statistics for each division.

division_summary = cleaned_df|>

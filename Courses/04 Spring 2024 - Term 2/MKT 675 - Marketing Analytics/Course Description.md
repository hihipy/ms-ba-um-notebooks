MKT 675. Marketing Analytics. 2 Credit Hours.

Big data, fast computing and clever algorithms have converged to allow managers to convert data into one of their key strategic assets. In response, managers are collecting large volumes of data from diverse sources such as point-of-sale, online and social media However, this data deluge does not automatically result in smart actions. To convert data to insights managers must develop the capability to transform data into knowledge through analytics. This has made analytics an important subject for business majors. One area where firms find analytics useful is marketing. Today firms use analytics to identify profitable customers, continuously track brands, and calculate optimal price promotions, test commercials, optimize media budgets across online and offline channels, design sales force allocation and decide the intensity of distribution channels. The goals of this course are to give you hands-on experience with data and analytics, teach you how to draw strategic marketing insights from data and show you how to make marketing decisions with greater precision without merely relying on “gut” decisions. This is not to say that intuition and creativity do not play a role in marketing. It means that analytical approaches combined with intuition makes for better marketing decisions.

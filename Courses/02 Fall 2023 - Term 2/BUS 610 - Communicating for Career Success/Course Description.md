BUS 610. Communicating for Career Success. 2 Credit Hours.

The modern businessperson faces a constantly evolving environment and must be able to confront and respond to an array of business issues. At the heart of an effective response is a critical, comprehensive analysis coupled with the ability to meaningfully and persuasively communicate that assessment and recommendations to a variety of constituencies. This course prepares business students for this by exposing them to a three-step process of problem solving in which they critically analyze the problem, and then communicate their analysis both in writing and orally. The critical thinking and communication elements of the course are supplemented with additional practical applications relating to career readiness, job search and job procurement.

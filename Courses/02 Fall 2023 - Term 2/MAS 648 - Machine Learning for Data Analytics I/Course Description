MAS 648. MACHINE LEARNING FOR DATA ANALYTICS I. 2 CREDIT HOURS.

Data Mining encompasses finding meaningful and useful trends in data. The meaningful part depends on the application and even the specific data set you are using. Another definition that can be used is that data mining is the application of statistical machine learning techniques to find these trends. Our focus in this course will be on the development and use of traditional and cutting edge data mining/machine learning techniques and their applications across a spectrum of data sets. The topics we will cover are in supervised learning (regression, classification), unsupervised learning (clustering, principal components analysis, factor analysis, etc), and if time permits semi-supervised learning and recommendation systems.

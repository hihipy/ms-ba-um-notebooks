MAS 640. Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting. 2 Credit Hours.

Time series data occur when a single experimental unit or process is observed repeatedly over time. Data of this type are common in finance and economics. Statistical methods that assume independence are inappropriate for time series data. This course will provide the students with the basic theory and tools for the statistical analysis and interpretation of time series data. Broadly, the methods may be categorized into time-domain and frequency-domain methods. Time-domain methods develop explicit models for the evolution of a process over time. Frequency-domain methods equivalently model the correlation structure of the time series. Other topics include methods for model-based estimation, model selection, diagnostics, forecasting, and computing as they relate to time series analysis.

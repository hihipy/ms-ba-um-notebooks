    "### Company Background\n",
    "\n",
    "HealthCo is a prominent, national distributor of medical supplies. Its primary customers include hospitals, doctor offices, outpatient clinics, and Managed Care facilities. Over many decades, HealthCo has built a reputation for providing excellent service and a fully integrated product line. The vast majority of its customers have come to expect next-day service for nearly the entire product portfolio. Typically, customers place their orders in the afternoon and receive deliveries during the first half of the following business day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this level of service, HealthCo operates a large network of distribution centers (DCs) across the nation. The number of DCs is strategically determined to ensure deliveries within the allowable 12-24 hour timeframe, necessitating proximity to the customers. Deliveries are managed using leased trucks. These are dedicated leases, giving HealthCo some control over the drivers and allowing the display of the company logo on the trucks' sides. The trucks depart the DCs early in the morning, following standardized routes. This is crucial as most customers, especially hospitals that aim to minimize the use of their expensive real estate for storage, receive deliveries daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the local market DCs, HealthCo also operates a few larger DCs. These serve as hubs for holding backup inventory or consolidating purchases from multiple vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "HealthCo's product portfolio is incredibly broad, and the characteristics of its products vary significantly. However, they all share the common requirement of next-day delivery. Understanding the vast range of offerings is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HealthCo stocks over 100,000 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs).\n",
    "- The product range includes both bulky or heavy and inexpensive items, such as paper hand towels and basic saline solutions, priced under $20 per case/container. On the other extreme, sutures (kits for wound closure) can cost several hundred dollars while weighing less than half an ounce.\n",
    "- Many items have large volumes with steady consumption, as they are routinely purchased by most customers. Examples include alcohol pads, bandages, and scalpels. Conversely, some items may sell only to a single customer because HealthCo is committed to offering any SKU demanded by any of its significantly large customers. For example, a doctor in a particular hospital may require a special surgical kit (e.g., a packaged unit of multiple items needed for a specific surgery, such as tonsil removal), which is also sold only in small quantities. Many items sell less than a few units per month.\n",
    "- Certain items can experience high volatility. For instance, products related to flu and cold treatment may see their demand spike sharply if the flu season is particularly severe or if an event like a SARS scare occurs.\n",
    "- Given the volumes and size of its business, HealthCo orders weekly from most suppliers for each Distribution Center (DC). Most suppliers ship immediately from their own stock, and deliveries are received within a couple of days. However, there is a range of scenarios. Some specialized items may require months of supplier lead time to fulfill an order. In other cases, suppliers may face quality issues (e.g., failure of sterilization tests) and could be out of stock for months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Need for Better Inventory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to product complexity, HealthCo relies primarily on enterprise IT systems like SAP or Oracle Supply Chain modules. These systems manage inventory using standard algorithms. However, a large team of planners monitors inventory positions and intervenes manually when issues arise. Additionally, DC managers have significant discretion to override orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this hybrid approach, HealthCo achieves a 97% service level (line-fill, meaning complete order fulfillment on next delivery). However, facing increased competition and market pressure for enhanced performance and shrinking margins, the Supply Chain team must reduce inventory and lower capital requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toni Morgan, head of the Supply Chain Special Projects team, is tasked with identifying inventory management strategies and targets to achieve these objectives. She begins by studying representative SKUs within a single DC, arguing that customer demands necessitate independent inventory per SKU at each DC."

    "\n",
    "Scalpel blades are purchased from a single supplier who also provides many other SKUs. The supplier ships daily. While any quantity can be ordered, only orders in multiples of full pallets (2,400 boxes per pallet) qualify for the negotiated price. Smaller quantities incur a 3% surcharge. Assuming no additional \"per order costs\" (as is typical) and a capital/storage cost of 10%, what is the economic order quantity (EOQ) for these scalpel blades? What order quantity would you recommend?\n",

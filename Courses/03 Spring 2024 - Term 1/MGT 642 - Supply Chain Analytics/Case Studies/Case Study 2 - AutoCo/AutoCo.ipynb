For our benefit, please state your assumptions clearly. In addition to noting the important drivers, if you choose to ignore a factor because it is not important in your view, please state what you left out and why."

    "AutoCo wants to play in the automotive parts space and become a major competitor to Autozone, Advance Auto Parts, O&#39;Reilly and the other players. Thanks to private equity funding, Toni gets to design and build an optimal Supply Chain infrastructure – no attention needs to be paid to legacy buildings, IT systems, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toni has already designed a national store/professional service local footprint and arrived at a similar footprint and type of in-market facility as the current national players – typical stores of 7500 sqft, with a couple of drivers and delivery vans, servicing both retail as well as the professional market."

    "\n",
    "Toni will obviously stock all the frequently needed retail and professional parts – air filters, brake pads and discs, etc., same as all the other players. However, she is thinking about offering a broader range of products. E.g., the Coral Gables location serves a fair number of repair shops that service very unique cars, such as Professor H&#39;s 1994 Ferrari 348. She is therefore considering how to think about stocking a part locally. \n",

    "b. Professor H has to replace a &#36;1000 brake cylinder on his Ferrari every 3 years. His is the only car in the area that uses these brake cylinders in the area. From an overall Supply Chain perspective, discuss under which conditions you would actually stock the cylinder locally and under which you might not - and what you might do instead. Give some examples with assumptions and numbers for the different choices, assume the EOQ from the manufacturer is 1 unit and the lead time is a couple of days (if you need to)."

Google Maps can be helpful  \n",

    "c. With your answer in part (b), would you build a DC network that can serve stores in one day? Or rather 2 days? To justify your choice, consider the following numbers: O&#39;Reilly as per annual report has ~5000 stores, 27 DCs, about &#36;9bn in revenue, and maybe &#36;7bn in inventory (roughly estimated), you can assume that ~60% of the inventory sits in stores, assume fixed cost for a DC to be ~&#36;7m – DCs are expensive. Assume as in class that we are delivering with a truck per 12 stores, 3x a week, with a cost of &#36;1000/truck-day. Assume that AutoCo will be as large as O&#39;Reilly and incur an overall carrying cost of 10% per year."
